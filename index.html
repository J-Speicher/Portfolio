          <h1>My Personal-Professional Profile</h1>
          <p>Hello! Welcome to my Personal-Professional Profile, where you can learn more about me
            (the amazing John Speicher) and my journey as a computer scientist. To begin, I am a 
            James Madison University new grad who aspires to be a software developer. However, many
            technical fields interest me, so I would be open to opportunities in other areas as well;
            what truly matters to me is doing work that makes a difference! Please continue to my 
            <strong> resume</strong> section to read in depth on the skills I have learned across my
            studies and various projects or to my <strong>about</strong> section to read more about 
            me as an individual. Thank you for visiting!</p>

                  Software engineering is a very generic term, but I have truly enjoyed all forms of computing thus 
                  far in my career including programming, UI development, algorithmic analysis, and more.
                  If I had to pick a profession, I would say that I enjoy software development (programming/ UI) the 
                  most. What I ultimately seek is the opportunity to work with a team to grow as a computer scientist and solve real-world problems.

                  What programming languages do I know?

              <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
                <div class="accordion-body">
                  In order from my best to worst programming languages, I have worked with C, Java, Rust, 
                  Python, Ruby, Haskell, and SQL. I believe that I have spread myself a little thin in 
                  learning so many technologies in a short span, so I am working on furthering my current 
                  skills.

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  My two best experiences as a leader are from being Assistant Senior Patrol Leader 
                  (second-highest authority) in Boy Scout Troop 828 as well as my training to become 
                  an empathetic leader through JMU's Make Your Mark on Madison program.
                  Overall, being a leader is about understanding your group's needs and how to 
                  individually change your methods to achieve a goal rather than applying rules that 
                  only benefit the majority. A leader should help everyone!

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  As I found my passion in computing, I officially worked as a dishwasher, cashier, 
                  "house mover", eye doctor's assistant, warehouse associate, and sandwich artist to 
                  support myself. I would have preferred to work in a relevant field to my studies, 
                  but I could not find an internship due to the effects COVID-19 had on me at the time. 
                  However, I have learned a lot since then!
