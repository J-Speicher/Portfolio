            <h2>Parallelized 2-D Particle Simulator</h2>
            <p>FEB 2024 - MAY 2024</p>
            <p>
                The focus of this research project is to learn about parallelism via CUDA and OpenGL, 
                which are common tools for achieving parallelism by delegating/ dividing tasks to CPU 
                cores. My team of three decided to parallelize a prior team's particle simulator with 
                various new algorithms (spatial mapping, quadtree, and parsing the X-axis) in order 
                to find the optimal approach. I have implemented a quadtree structure that has 
                boosted the performance of the particle simulator when run serially but will require 
                modifications to run in parallel. Overall, I have furthered my knowledge of the 
                unique benefits of these data structures and parallelism while enjoying a unique 
                challenge!

            <h2>Movie Content Website</h2>
            <p>FEB 2024 - MAY 2024</p>
            <p>
                My goal for this project is to create an interactive, appealing movie review website 
                via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the bottom of this home page are several links to 
                pages for bookmarking films to watch, viewing external movie review websites, 
                viewing current popular movies, and creating/ viewing movie reviews. This project
                also utilizes APIs to request the top 100 movies from the Movie Database API and
                streaming services available in a given country.

          <h2>Autonomous Drone Delivery System</h2>
          <p>SEPT 2021 - MAY 2022</p>
          <p>
            This project was one of my favorites because us students had complete freedom with 
            minimal supervision. As a team of five, we created an 
            autonomous drone delivery service based at JMU for six-packs. We each had our separate 
            roles, mine being creating an ID and 
            facial recognition program, but we all worked together to plan, budget, and test each 
            drone design.

          <h2>Custom Ruby Spreadsheet</h2>
          <p>SEPT 2023 - DEC 2023</p>
          <p>
            Creating a custom spreadsheet was a solo coding project written in Ruby to create an 
            interactive spreadsheet for custom data types. This project taught me a lot about Ruby 
            as I started working with primitive values and finished with building a lexer and a 
            parser that can process data cells and add them to the spreadsheet. This class was 
            focused on learning programming languages and their unique specialties, and it gave 
            me a new sense of how to efficiently write code.

        <h2>Network Connection - DHCP Protocol</h2>
        <p>OCT 2023 - NOV 2023</p>
        <p>
            As I learned about networking, I developed a simplified DHCP protocol program in C to 
            showcase my knowledge of client-server interactions with a classmate. This was a 
            difficult project because this was my first time writing a program that actively 
            communicates with a separate server, but I learned a lot about network protocols and 
            how to process IP addresses. This class also introduced me to parallelism, and we 
            specifically applied the use of pipes in this and other projects to direct the flow 
            of programs.
